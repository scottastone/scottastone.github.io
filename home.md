Hey there.

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in the department of psychology at the University of Alberta, supervised by [Craig Chapman](acelab.ca) and Anthony Singhal.

I am interested in multimodal data collection, particularly eyetracking and motion capture. I also dabble in reinforcement learning and EEG.
